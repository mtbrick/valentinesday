## Template for Valentine's Day web card contest
This is a contest. Yes, a real contest with an awesomely bad prize. And it is also a good way to put to work your newly-acquired HTML and CSS skillz (not a typo).

### Scenario
We have been hired by a Valentine Day's card manufacturer. We need to create a website with the following pages:
-  A home page introducing the company and this specific product (Valentine's cards)
-  A page (inside its own sub-folder) announcing the "love" Valentine's cards models, which should include one for a significant other and one for a family member. **This folder should have one external CSS files formatting all the html files inside it**
- A page (inside its own sub-folder) announcing the "hate" Valentine's cards model. We only have one model and it should be for an ex significant other. **This page needs internal CSS rules**

### Steps
1.  Download and clone this repo to your computer
    - Click on an icon that looks like this ![Download icon](icon.jpg) here in GitHub (should be at the top of the page) 
2.  Let the magic happen and you should see the repo cloned in your GitHub app.
3.  Open and edit the skeleton files with your own content.
4.  Use appropriate colors, fonts, and images.
5.  We need good and effective content!
6.  Commit and sync your own version of the repo to your GitHub account.
7.  Create a `gh-pages` branch of your repo to have a nice user-ready website.
8.  Submit your website's URL to the "Valentine's Contest" Discussion forum in Canvas before Midnight 02/12.

We we select the winner in class 02/16.
